# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project implements machine learning algorithms to predict breast cancer diagnosis based on various features. The dataset used contains medical measurements and diagnostic results.

## Project Contents

- Jupyter notebooks with implementations of six classification algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Naive Bayes
- Data files (excluded from GitHub via `.gitignore`).
- Code for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

## How to Use

1. Download the dataset separately (not included in this repo).
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks to train and test the models.
3. Modify or extend the code to try different algorithms or features.

## Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
